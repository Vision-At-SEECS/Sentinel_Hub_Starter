# Sentinel Hub Starter Pack

Welcome to the Sentinel Hub Starter pack, a useful resource to get basic understanding of downloading satellite imagery from different satellite resources (Sentinel, Landsat, Modis, ....) using Sentinel Hub's Process API in python. This repository contains python scripts along with video tutorials to help you kick start your Sentinel Hub journey for Earth observation, data analysis and visulaization.

## Introduction

### What is Sentinel Hub Process API?

The Sentinel Hub Process API is part of the Sentinel Hub ecosystem, which provides easy access to a vast repository of Earth observation data, including Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, Landsat, and more. With the Process API, you can harness the capabilities of the Sentinel Hub service to retrieve, process, and analyze satellite imagery in a seamless and efficient manner. 

### Pre-requisites

To use Sentinel Hub's Process API in python, you'll need to have:

- Python
- [Sentinel Hub Account](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/)
- [Python Library provided by Sentinel Hub](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 


## Downloading Satellite Imagery

To cover the basis of downloading satellite imagery using Sentinel Hub, couple of video tutorials are created. Each video covers a specific example and walk you through python notebook and other anciliary resources in an interactive manner which you can easily follow along for hands-on practice.

### Video 1: Retrieving Single Satellite Imagery

It is an introductory video on Sentinel Hub and resources associated with such as Sentinel Hub Requests Builder. After following the tutorial, you'll be able to define a region of interest, write python code, download any satellite imagery for a single date with least cloud cover and finally visualize it.
