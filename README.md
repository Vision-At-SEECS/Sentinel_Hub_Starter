## Introduction

### What is Sentinel Hub Process API?

The Sentinel Hub Process API is part of the Sentinel Hub ecosystem, which provides easy access to a vast repository of Earth observation data, including Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, Landsat, and more. With the Process API, you can harness the capabilities of the Sentinel Hub service to retrieve, process, and analyze satellite imagery in a seamless and efficient manner. 

### Pre-requisites

To use Sentinel Hub's Process API in python, you'll need to have:

- Python
- [Sentinel Hub Account](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/)
- [Python Library provided by Sentinel Hub](https://sentinelhub-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 


## Downloading Satellite Imagery

To cover the basis of downloading satellite imagery using Sentinel Hub, couple of video tutorials are created. Each video covers a specific task and walk you through python notebook and other anciliary resources in an interactive manner which you can easily follow along for hands-on practice.
